<p>
J_Max is an upcoming movie shop based in kinoo. We have integrated our shop with state of the art technological advancements. This android application is just but one of the many IT advancements.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to our developer Dennis Mufasa who is the head of innovation at Mufasa_Co, we are able to provide our customers with the best services a movie shop could possibly offer customers.
</p>
<p>This shop is so automated a toddler could operate everyday operations unsupervised. Ok maybe not a toddler but little to no training is required for our staff. </p>
<p>Our shop offers delivery services to customers who live within 20 minutes of the movies shop. That is as far as CBD moving down waiyaki way and as far Kikuyu moving up said way.</p>
<p>Our employees are good conversationalists and very cheerful.</p>
<p>J_Max is your one stop movie shop but don't take our word for it, come on over and find it out for yourself.</p>
